    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/atyant-yadav/Hacktoberfest2020.git
    ```
* Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main https://github.com/atyant-yadav/Hacktoberfest2020.git
    ```
* Create your feature branch
    ```

* The maintainer of this repo will review the changes you have made. If they find any errors/mistakes, they may request some changes; in which case, you should make the appropriate changes in your forked repository and then commit them again. Note: Make sure you make changes in the same branch you previously requested PR from.

* At last, if maintainers review and come to a conclusion that your PR is good to go, then your request will be approved and will be merged.
