# here i want access the factorial functions of 19- Writing .. file
# import mod1

# default python will excute all the code inside it and will create a folder 
# called __pycache in same directiory
# since the mod 1 is getting excuted we comment the print staements in global
# scope but then in mod1 the code is not useable. What i want is when i 
# run mod1 it should run all the print staements but when i import it , it must
# not run those
# nim1=10
# print(mod1.factorial(nim1))

# import math
# help(math)

# It has proper description name and functions
# import mod1
# help(mod1)


# package is nothing but a python directiory
# all u have to do is create  a empty file of py in same directiory
# and Write __init__.py 
# now the particular folder will be considered as python package
